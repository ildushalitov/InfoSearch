After backlash to her performance at the Paris Olympics, the French Malian singer’s fifth album uses her signature blend of Afrobeats, zouk, pop, and R&B to subtly reframe the narrative.

Aya Nakamura spent the years following her 2023 album DNK embroiled in national drama that had little to do with her music. The mere suggestion that the French Malian singer might perform at the 2024 Paris Olympics ignited an ugly backlash, fueling a racist opposition campaign and a pearl-clutching debate over who ought to represent France on its biggest international stage. Nakamura sang anyway, reminding the world why she remains one of the most popular Francophone singers working today.
Destinée, her fifth album, meets the furor by leaning even harder into a sound only she can deliver. The production returns to her familiar melange of Afrobeats, zouk, pop, and R&B; features from Joé Dwèt Filé, JayO, and others add ripples of kompa, reggae, and Latin neo-soul. At 30, Nakamura sounds steelier, almost amused by her critics. In her writing, she doubles down on her signature braid of Parisian argot (slang) and Bambara, a wink to her fans and a cheeky taunt to the institutions that would prefer a more demure entertainer.
If Nakamura’s third album, AYA, was “the sound of a young woman and mother who has found the love she deserves,” Destinée is that of a woman scorned. These love songs are pressure cookers, simmering with threats and accusations. Some play coy, like “Alien,” where she boasts about being insatiable, or the airy Kali Uchis collab “Baby boy,” where flirtation doubles as a power play. But on “Dis-moi,” Nakamura wonders if she’s sleeping beside the devil, and Jamaican star Shenseea’s warning lands like a line from a thriller: “I’ll hurt you if you hurt me.”
Most compelling is how Destinée reframes Nakamura’s public narrative without stooping. She doesn’t sermonize about her right to belong; she treats those arguments as beneath her. Lovers, haters, and the establishment blur into a composite antagonist, a symbol of everyone who has tried to shrink her. “Blues,” a stripped-down ballad that recalls the intimacy of “Fly,” is Nakamura at her most vulnerable, voice cracking against soft keys and a heartbeat. But running beneath the album’s flexes and dismissals is a deeper inquiry into power: how it’s gained, lost, reclaimed, sometimes shared. She doesn’t directly address the spectacle surrounding her Olympic appearance or her legal issues with her ex, but when she murmurs about numbing emotions and burying bad memories on opener “Anesthésie,” it’s an easy connection to make.
For all its confidence, Destinée can rely too heavily on familiar formulas. The album stretches to 18 tracks, and many settle into a similar midtempo sway, with percussion so uniform it begins to feel automated. The hooks are sticky but predictable—you’ll crave a wild solo or switch-up to jolt the hypnotic groove. Still, Nakamura stands 10 toes down in her dualities: tender and ruthless, glamorous and tired, wounded and unbothered. Destinée distills the playfulness, poise, and melodic grace that have made her a generational pop star, and with this album, she invites us to revel in the fact that she’s still here.
